#OperatAR
#Inspiration
#We wanted to add AR objects onto clothing, as well as create something medical-related.

What it does
It helps users learn how to perform surgery on a pretend patient and how to give directions in an operation room.

How we built it
Unity, Vuforia, Android Studio

Challenges we ran into
The AR camera wouldn't turn on sometimes.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Create an AR app with Google Speech API

What's next for OperatAR
Add animated objects in the program so that it looks like the user is looking at a live patient
